                <h3>Prism</h3>
                <p>Prism is a differential privacy platform I built with Rails 8, PostgreSQL, and Python's differential privacy libraries to enable secure analysis of sensitive datasets. The system manages privacy budgets, validates queries for safety, and supports multiple cryptographic backends including DP, MPC, and homomorphic encryption. Added collaborative data rooms for multi-party computation scenarios, full audit logging, and a Python executor that adds calibrated noise to query results while maintaining formal privacy guarantees.</p>

                <h3>Core Fellowship Platform</h3>
                <p>This platform brings applications, interviews, and placement decisions into one shared system, eliminating spreadsheets, scattered forms, and manual tracking. Interview feedback and preferences are recorded in real time, giving organizers a live view of the entire applicant pool and where each candidate stands. A guided matching tool then helps leadership quickly pair students with startups based on skills and preferences, while built-in messaging handles notifications and next steps automatically.</p>
